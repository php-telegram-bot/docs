# :rocket: Let's Play

## Scope of the "Let's Play"

All the chapters in the "Let's Play"[^1] part of the guide are meant for the most newbies to the subject of botting. Here we will cover basics like setting up a local development environment through the use of **Vagrant[^2]**, how to use **Composer**[^3] to download, install and update the framework through time, how the [Telegram APIs][api][^4] work and eventually we will learn how to write code for few commands.

At the end of the guide it will be up to your creativity to actually build a bot that suit your needs :v:


!!! info
    We will be using the [`example-bot`][example-bot] as a base reference thanks to its completeness and "plug-n-play" approach — kinda, but don't be afraid :wink:.



!!! tip
    You can safely skip to the advanced [Core](Core/introduction.md) section if you already know how to:

    * setup and use vagrant
    * use git
    * use composer
    * install and configure a MySQL database
    * have a basic understanding of how the [Telegram API][api] works



<!-- footnotes -->
[^1]: The name is inspired by the many let's play series of popular games that walk you through the plot :grin:

[^2]: [Vagrant][vagrant] allows to work in a virtualized environment, it's a safe bet to not mess up your own system.

[^3]: [Composer][composer] TL;DR it's the package manager of PHP, it will take care that everything _under the hood_ is updated and functioning.

[^4]: **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterface, to make it simple it's a method that allows cross-talk between different applications.
